comment is a small preprocessor for stripping comments from input. It
is useful for languages that don't support comments on their own. comment
supports both block comments and single-line comment. Block comments do not
nest. By default C-like block comment delimiters (/* comment */) and
C++-like single-line comments (// comment) are used, but any other
string may be specified instead.

To install, run `make', followed by `make install' (possibly as root):

	$ make
	# make install
